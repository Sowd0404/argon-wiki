Projects describe how the instance tree should look like and how files should be processed along the way!

## Project File

Argon projects are JSON files that have the `.project.json` extension. They have the following fields:

| Field           | Description                                                                                           | Default      |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| `name`          | The name of the project, displayed by Argon                                                           | **Required** |
| `tree`          | An [Instance Description](#instance-description) describing the root instance of the project          | **Required** |
| `host`          | The host name that Argon server should be running on                                                  | `localhost`  |
| `port`          | The port number that Argon server should be running on                                                | `8000`       |
| `gameId`        | Limit Argon clients to only sync with this project when the game ID matches                           | `null`       |
| `placeIds`      | Limit Argon clients to only sync with this project when one of the place IDs matches                  | `[]`         |
| `ignoreGlobs`   | Exclude files that match any of these globs from processing and syncing                               | `[]`         |
| `syncRules`     | Custom set of user-defined [Sync Rules](#sync-rule) that define how files should be processed         | `[]`         |
| `syncback`      | [Syncback Settings](#syncback-settings) that control how instances are synced back to the file system | `null`       |
| `legacyScripts` | Use the legacy script run context                                                                     | `true`       |

## Instance Description

Instance Descriptions correspond to the actual Roblox Instances in the project.

| Field           | Description                                                           |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$className`    | The ClassName of the Instance being described                         |
| `$path`         | The path on the filesystem that should be the source of this instance |
| `$properties`   | Properties to apply to the instance                                   |
| `$keepUnknowns` | Whether instances that Argon doesn't know about should be deleted     |

All other fields in an Instance Description are turned into instances whose name is the key.

:::danger
Note that you can't set both `$className` and `$path` at the same time!

## Sync Rule

Sync Rule allows you to define how specific file should be interpreted and how its name should be mapped to the instance name.

| Field          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `type`         | The type of file this rule applies to, valid options are: **Project**, **InstanceData**, **ServerScript**, **ClientScript**, **ModuleScript**, **StringValue**, **LocalizationTable**, **JsonModule**, **TomlModule**, **JsonModel**, **RbxmModel**, **RbxmxModel** |
| `pattern`      | A glob pattern that matches the file path                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `childPattern` | A glob pattern that matches folder-contained file path                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `exclude`      | A list of glob patterns that exclude the file path from this rule                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `suffix`       | A suffix to stripe from the file path to get the instance name                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

## Syncback Settings

Syncback Settings allow you to control which instances and properties should be synced back to the file system.

| Setting            | Description                                                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ignoreGlobs`      | Exclude files that match any of these globs from processing changes |
| `ignoreNames`      | Exclude instances with these names from processing changes          |
| `ignoreClasses`    | Exclude instances with these classes from processing changes        |
| `ignoreProperties` | Exclude these properties from being saved to the file system        |

## Example Projects

Example project of a plugin or model:

```json
{
  "name": "Plugin",
  "ignoreGlobs": ["**/*.spec.lua"],
  "tree": {
    "$path": "src"
  }
}
```

Example project of the game:

```json
{
  "name": "Game",
  "port:": 8080,
  "gameId": "1234567890",
  "tree": {
    "$className": "DataModel",

    "ReplicatedStorage": {
      "$path": "src/Shared",

      "Config": {
        "$className": "Configuration",
        "$keepUnknowns": true,

        "StartPos": {
          "$className": "Vector3Value",
          "$properties": {
            "Value": [0, 0, 0]
          }
        }
      }
    },

    "ServerScriptService": {
      "$path": "src/Server"
    },

    "StarterPlayer": {
      "$properties": {
        "CharacterWalkSpeed": 24
      },

      "StarterPlayerScripts": {
        "$path": "src/Client"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
