One of the main features of Argon is the extreme ability to customize it to your liking. This page will guide you through the process of configuring Argon to fit your needs!

## Argon CLI

Argon command line interface is configurable through two main ways.

### Command Options

When running `argon`, you can add options to customize the behavior of the [Commands](./commands/cli.mdx). Here are some examples:

- `--docs` or `-d` - Include documentation in the project
- `--template` or `-T` - Select the project template

### Global Config

Argon has a global config file that can be used to set default settings for the CLI. The configuration file is located at:

- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.argon\config.toml`
- macOS & Linux: `~/.argon/config.toml`

And can have the following settings:

| Setting          | Default      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| host             | `localhost`  | Default server host name when live syncing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| port             | `8000`       | Default server port when live syncing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| template         | `place`      | Default project [Template](./getting-started/new-project.mdx#project-templates) to use when creating a new project with `argon init`. Argon comes with five templates: **place**, **plugin**, **package**, **model** and **quick**. But you can add your own! Just create a new folder with the desired name and contents in `.argon/templates/`                                                  |
| license          | `Apache-2.0` | Default project license [SPDX identifier](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository#searching-github-by-license-type) to use when creating a new project with `argon init`. Argon will pull license template from GitHub so if there is no internet connection, placeholder will be used instead |
| include_docs     | `true`       | Controls whether documentation files should be included in the project (**README**, **LICENSE**, **CHANGELOG**) when running `argon init` and present in the project **template**                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| use_git          | `true`       | Toggles the use of [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for source control. If enabled Argon will initialize a new repository and add `.gitignore` file when running `argon init` and present in the project **template**                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| use_wally        | `false`      | Whether to use use [Wally](https://wally.run/) for project package management. When enabled Argon will install dependencies automatically, add `wally.toml` file when running `argon init` and add `Packages` to the project file if present in the **template**                                                                                                                                  |
| run_async        | `false`      | Whether to run Argon asynchronously every time you use `argon serve`, `argon build` or `argon sourcemap` (with `--watch` enabled). Useful when running multiple Argon instances as it will free up the terminal. To stop running Argon sessions use `argon stop` command                                                                                                                          |
| scan_ports       | `true`       | When enabled Argon will scan for the first available port if selected one is already in use                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| detect_project   | `true`       | Whether Argon should intelligently detect the project type. This allows to run [roblox-ts](https://roblox-ts.com/) or to install [Wally](https://wally.run/) packages automatically, regardless if `use_wally` or `ts_mode` settings are enabled                                                                                                                                                  |
| smart_paths      | `false`      | If enabled smart path resolver will be used which makes providing path arguments or options easier and faster. When active Argon will try to locate the file with its shorter form e.g. `argon serve dev` instead of `argon serve dev.project.json`                                                                                                                                               |
| with_sourcemap   | `false`      | Whether Argon should generate sourcemap by default when running [Serve](./commands/cli.mdx#serve) or [Build](./commands/cli.mdx#build) command. Useful for [Luau LSP](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/luau-lsp) users                                                                                                                                                                            |
| build_xml        | `false`      | If no path is provided, [Build](./commands/cli.mdx#build) command will always use the Roblox XML format instead of binary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| check_updates    | `true`       | Whether to check for new Argon releases on CLI startup (limited to once per hour). This setting also updates Argon plugin if `install_plugin` is enabled and project templates if `update_templates` is enabled                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| auto_update      | `false`      | When enabled Argon will automatically install Argon updates if available. Otherwise you will be prompted for confirmation. This setting also works with `install_plugin` and `update_templates`                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| install_plugin   | `true`       | Whether to install Roblox plugin locally by default and keep it updated when above settings are enabled                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| update_templates | `true`       | Whether to update default project templates when new ones are available and `check_updates` setting is enabled                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| rojo_mode        | `false`      | When enabled Argon will use [Rojo](https://rojo.space/) namespace by default when creating a new project                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

### Workspace Config

Works exactly the same as the [Global Config](#global-config) but is specified at workspace level. To initialize one you need to create `argon.toml` file in the root of your project (right next to the [Project File](/api/project#project-file)). If workspace config exists, it will override the global one.

:::note
Argon will only be able to load workspace config if it exists in the current working directory or parent directory of the `PROJECT` argument (only applies to `init`, `serve`, `build` and `sourcemap` commands)
:::

## Argon Plugin

Argon Roblox Studio plugin is configurable through the settings menu that can be accessed by clicking on the gear icon in the main plugin window. At the very top you can control whether to toggle settings on the:

- `Global` level
- `Game` level
- `Place` level

Here are the settings you can change:

| Setting               | Default     | Description                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Server Host           | `localhost` | The host name of the server that plugin should connect to in order to start live syncing                                                                              |
